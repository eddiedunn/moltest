# Task ID: 9
# Title: Exit Code and Error Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement proper exit codes and comprehensive error handling for CI integration
# Details:
Ensure moltest exits with code 0 if all scenarios pass, non-zero if any fail. Handle various error conditions: Molecule not installed, no scenarios found, cache file issues, report writing failures. Provide clear error messages for each condition. Handle keyboard interrupts gracefully by cleaning up running processes. Add version compatibility checks for Ansible Core 2.15 and Molecule >= 4.0.

# Test Strategy:
Test exit codes with various scenario outcomes, verify error handling for missing dependencies, confirm graceful interrupt handling, and validate version checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Exit Code Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the main execution flow to return appropriate exit codes based on test results
### Details:
Update the main function to return exit code 0 when all scenarios pass successfully. Return exit code 1 when any scenario fails. Ensure this exit code is properly propagated to the system when the program terminates. Add a constant or enum to define exit codes for different failure types for future extensibility.

## 2. Implement Dependency Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add validation for required dependencies and version compatibility checks
### Details:
Create a function to check if Molecule is installed and accessible. Implement version compatibility checks for Ansible Core 2.15+ and Molecule 4.0+. Use subprocess to run version check commands. Return specific error codes and messages when dependencies are missing or incompatible versions are detected. Handle these checks early in program execution.

## 3. Implement File Operation Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add robust error handling for all file operations including cache and report files
### Details:
Wrap all file operations (read/write) in try-except blocks with specific error messages. Handle cache file issues such as permission errors, corruption, or missing files. Add error handling for report writing failures with appropriate error codes. Implement a function to validate cache file integrity before using it. Ensure temporary files are cleaned up even when errors occur.

## 4. Implement Scenario Validation and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Add checks and error handling for scenario discovery and validation
### Details:
Implement error handling for when no scenarios are found in the project. Add validation for scenario configuration files with clear error messages for malformed configs. Handle path resolution errors when locating scenario directories. Return specific error codes for each scenario-related error condition. Add logging to help diagnose scenario discovery issues.

## 5. Implement Signal Handling and Graceful Shutdown [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Add signal handlers to ensure clean process termination on interrupts
### Details:
Implement signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM to catch keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) and termination signals. Ensure all child processes are properly terminated when the program is interrupted. Add cleanup functions to remove temporary files and restore terminal state. Log appropriate messages when shutdown is triggered by signals. Ensure the correct exit code is still returned even during interruption.
