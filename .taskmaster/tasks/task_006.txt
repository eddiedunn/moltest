# Task ID: 6
# Title: Console Output and Color-Coded Summary
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement rich console output with color-coded test results and summary
# Details:
Create reporter.py module for console output formatting. Use colorama for cross-platform ANSI color support. Display real-time scenario status as tests complete (✓ PASSED / ✗ FAILED). Generate final summary table with scenario names, status, and totals. Support --no-color flag and auto-detect TTY. Include execution time in summary if available. Format output similar to pytest with clear pass/fail indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Test color output on different terminals, verify --no-color works, confirm summary formatting is readable, and validate color auto-detection.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create reporter.py module with colorama integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the reporter.py module with basic structure and integrate colorama for cross-platform color support
### Details:
Create a new reporter.py file with a Reporter class. Import and initialize colorama for cross-platform ANSI color support. Implement color constants for success (green), failure (red), warning (yellow), and info (blue). Add a command-line argument parser option for --no-color flag. Implement color detection logic that respects both the --no-color flag and auto-detects if output is going to a TTY.

## 2. Implement real-time scenario status reporting [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions to display real-time test results as scenarios complete
### Details:
Add methods to Reporter class for displaying individual test results in real-time: report_pass(scenario_name) and report_fail(scenario_name, error_message). Use appropriate color coding (green checkmark for pass, red X for fail). Format output similar to pytest with clear indicators. Ensure proper indentation and consistent formatting. Include scenario name in the output.

## 3. Implement execution time tracking [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add functionality to track and report execution time for scenarios and overall test run
### Details:
Extend the Reporter class to track start and end times for the entire test run and individual scenarios. Create helper methods to calculate and format execution times (e.g., in milliseconds for quick tests, seconds for longer ones). Store timing data in a structure that can be accessed when generating the final summary.

## 4. Create summary table generator [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to generate a formatted summary table of all test results
### Details:
Add a generate_summary_table method to the Reporter class that creates a well-formatted table showing all scenario results. Include columns for scenario name, status (PASSED/FAILED), and execution time. Calculate and display totals (total tests, passed, failed, total execution time). Use appropriate color coding for the summary information. Ensure table has consistent alignment and borders.

## 5. Integrate reporter with test runner [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the reporter module with the main test runner to provide real-time output during test execution
### Details:
Modify the main test runner to instantiate and use the Reporter class. Add hooks to report test results as they complete. Pass command line arguments for color settings to the Reporter. Ensure the summary table is displayed after all tests complete. Handle edge cases such as no tests run, all tests passed, or all tests failed with appropriate messaging.
