# Description: Implement CI-specific features for GitLab CI and GitHub Actions integration
# Details:
Add CI environment detection (CI=true, etc.) for automatic --no-color. Optimize output for CI logs with clear section headers. Ensure report files are written to accessible locations. Add example CI configurations for GitLab CI and GitHub Actions in documentation. Test containerized execution scenarios. Validate artifact generation and upload workflows.

# Test Strategy:
Test in actual CI environments (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions), verify artifact generation, confirm output readability in CI logs, and validate example configurations.
