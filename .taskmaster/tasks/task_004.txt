# Task ID: 4
# Title: Molecule Test Executor
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement core execution engine to run Molecule tests for discovered scenarios
# Details:
Create executor.py module using subprocess.run to execute 'molecule test -s <scenario>' commands. Change working directory to appropriate base path before execution. Stream Molecule output to console in real-time while capturing return codes. Handle timeouts and interruptions gracefully. Record execution time and status (pass/fail) for each scenario. Continue execution even if scenarios fail to gather complete results.

# Test Strategy:
Test execution with passing and failing scenarios, verify output streaming works, confirm proper working directory handling, and validate return code capture.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic executor.py module structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the initial structure for the executor.py module with necessary imports and class/function definitions
### Details:
Create a new file executor.py with imports for subprocess, time, signal, and other required modules. Define a MoleculeExecutor class with methods for initialization, execution, and result handling. Include placeholder methods for running tests, handling output, and managing timeouts.

## 2. Implement subprocess execution with real-time output streaming [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core functionality to execute Molecule test commands and stream output to console in real-time
### Details:
Implement the run_test method using subprocess.Popen with appropriate pipes for stdout and stderr. Set up a loop to read output lines in real-time and print them to console. Ensure the working directory is changed to the appropriate base path before execution using os.chdir(). Capture the return code to determine test success/failure.

## 3. Add timeout and interruption handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement mechanisms to handle test timeouts and user interruptions gracefully
### Details:
Add timeout parameter to the run_test method. Implement signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM. Use threading or signal.alarm for timeout implementation. When timeout or interruption occurs, terminate the subprocess properly, log the event, and return appropriate status. Ensure resources are cleaned up properly in all cases.

## 4. Implement execution metrics collection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add functionality to record execution time and status for each scenario
### Details:
Enhance the run_test method to record start and end times using time.time(). Calculate and store execution duration. Create a TestResult class or data structure to hold scenario name, status (pass/fail), return code, execution time, and any error messages. Return this result object from the run_test method.

## 5. Implement multi-scenario execution with failure handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functionality to run multiple scenarios sequentially and continue execution even when scenarios fail
### Details:
Implement a run_scenarios method that takes a list of scenario paths and executes each one using the run_test method. Collect results from each execution regardless of pass/fail status. Continue execution even when scenarios fail. Return a comprehensive results collection with data from all executed scenarios. Add logging to record overall execution statistics.
